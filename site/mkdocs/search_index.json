You should also get \njupyter\n, which you should be able to install from ipython.\nTo install IJulia, you type \nPkg.add(\"IJulia\")\n from Julia.\nThen, you just need to type \nusing IJulia\n once.  This will tell jupyter about the Julia kernel.  To run Julia notebooks, you now type \njupyter notebook\n.  You can select the kernel your new notebook is using.\n\n\nDan recommends installing the anaconda distribution of python.\nYou will then need to install some things from that, like\nconda install jupyter (the new notebooks package)\nconda install mathjax\nconda install matplotlib\n\n\nThis repository contains projects implemented in Julia by Dan Spielman's group.

One, yinsGraph, is for doing graph theory and solving Laplacian systems.  It's documentation is at \nyinsGraph.md\n\n\nI would like to use the documentation pages in this root directory to discuss issues with how to get Julia to work well.  For now, I'll just ask some questions and write a little that I've figured out.  If you figure some out, please write it here.\n\n\nConverting to Julia 0.4\n\n\nA description of the changes made in Julia 0.4 appears to be here\n[https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/release-0.4/NEWS.md]\n(https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/release-0.4/NEWS.md)\n\n\nThe first problem you will encounter when using Julia 0.4 is that it is stingier about its load path.  It won't load something from the current directory unless it is in the load path.  You can add a directory to the load path like\n\n\npush!(LOAD_PATH,\n.\n)\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\npush!(LOAD_PATH,\n/Users/[your_username]/git/julia/yinsGraph\n)\n\n\n\n\nTo overcome this issue, you can add the above line to the end of the julia.rc file, found in\n\n\n/Applications/Julia-0.4.0-rc4.app/Contents/Resources/julia/etc/julia\n\n\n\n\nJulia 0.4 lets you take advantage of docstrings.\nFor example, \n?ringGraph\n produces\n\n\nThe simple ring on n vertices\n\n\n\n\nWhen having a multiline comment, make sure that lines don't have starting and trailing spaces.\nThis will mess up the indentation when calling '?func_name'.\n\n\nSmall details\n\n\n\n\nJulia 0.4 is trying to wean you off Matlab-like notation.  You should no longer create vectors like \n[1:n]\n.  Instead, you should type \ncollect(1:n)\n\n\n\n\nJulia Notebooks\n\n\nTo get the Julia notebooks working, I presently type \njupyter notebook\n.\nI then select the kernel to be Julia-0.3.11.\nIt seems important to run this command from a directory that contains all the directories\nthat have notebooks that you will use.  In particular, I advise against \"uploading\" notebooks\nfrom other directories.  That has only given me trouble.\n\n\nThe calico extensions that seem to be hosted at Brynmawr seem interesting.\nI haven't yet figured out how to get them to work.\nHere are the relevent links:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://jupyter.cs.brynmawr.edu/hub/dblank/public/Jupyter%20Help.ipynb\n\n\nhttp://jupyter.cs.brynmawr.edu/hub/dblank/public/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Users%20Manual.ipynb\n\n\n\n\nTo turn a notebook into html, you type something like\n\n\nipython nbconvert Laplacians.ipynb\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nipython nbconvert --to markdown --stdout Sampler.ipynb \n SamplerNotebook.md\n\n\n\n\nWorkflows\n\n\nJulia has an IDE called Juno.  Both Dan and Serban have encountered some trouble with it: we have both found that it sometimes refuses to reload .jl code that we have written.  Please document workflows that you have found useful here:\n\n\nDan's current workflow:\n\n\n\n\nI use emacs (which has a mode for Julia) and the notebooks.\n\n\nI develop Julia code in a \"temporary\" file with a name like develX.jl.  While I am developing, this code is not included by the module to which it will eventually belong.\n\n\n\n\nAfter modifying code, I reload it with \ninclude(\"develX.jl\")\n.  This works fine for reloading methods.  It is not a good way to reload modules or types.  So, I usually put the types either in a separate file, or in my julia notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am writing this documention in MacDown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd your current workflow here:\n\n\nThings to be careful of (common bugs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia passes vectors and matrices to routines by reference, rather than by copying them.  If you type \nx = y\n when x and y are arrays, then this will make x a pointer to y.  If you want x to be a copy of y, type \nx = copy(y)\n.  This can really mess up matlab programmers.  I wrote many functions that were modifying their arguments without realizing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, if you type \nx = x + y\n, then x becomes a newly allocated vector and no longer refers to the original.  This is true even if you type \nx += y\n.  Here is an example that shows two of the possible behaviors, and the difference between what happens inside functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdds b in to a\n\nfunction addA2B(a,b)\n    for i in 1:length(a)\n        a[i] += b[i]\n    end\nend\n\n\nFails to add b in to a\n\nfunction addA2Bfail(a,b)\n    a += b\nend\n\na = [1 0]\nb = [2 2]\naddA2B(a,b)\na\n\n1x2 Array{Int64,2}:\n 3  2\n\na = [1 0]\nb = [2 2]\naddA2Bfail(a,b)\na\n\n1x2 Array{Int64,2}:\n 1  0\n\na += b\na\n\n1x2 Array{Int64,2}:\n 3  2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are used to programming in Matlab, you might be tempted to type a line like \nfor i in 1:10,\n.  \nDo not put extra commas in Julia!\n  It will cause bad things to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia sparse matrix entries dissapear if they are set to 0. In order to overcome this, use the \nsetValue\n function. \nsetValue(G, u, i, 0)\n will set \nweighti(G, u, i)\n to 0 while also leaving \n(u, nbri(G, u, i))\n in the matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful Julia functions\n\n\nI am going to make a short list of Julia functions/features that I find useful.  Please add those that you use often as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocstrings: in the above example, I used a docstring to document each function.  You can get these by typing \n?addA2B\n.  You can also  \nwrite longer docstrings and use markdown\n.  I suggest putting them in front of every function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmethods(foo)\n lists all methods with the name foo.\n\n\n\n\nfieldnames(footype)\n tells you all the fields of footype.  Note that this is 0.4.  In 0.3.11, you type \nnames(footype)\n\n\n\n\njulia\n a = sparse(rand(3,3));\njulia\n fieldnames(a)\n5-element Array{Symbol,1}:\n :m\n :n\n :colptr\n :rowval\n :nzval\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing code in Julia\n\n\nThe best way that I've found of figuring out what's slowing down my code has been to use \n@code_warntype\n.  It only exists in version 4 of Julia.  For this reason, I keep one of those around.\n\n\nNote that the first time you run a piece of code in Julia, it gets compiled.  So, you should run it on a small example before trying to time it.  Then, use \n@time\n to time your code.\n\n\nI recommend reading the Performance Tips in the Julia documentation, not that I've understood all of it yet.\n\n\nVectorization is Bad.\n\n\nJulia is the anti-matlab in that vectorization is slow.\nStill it is a good way to write your code the first time.\nHere are some examples of code that adds one vector into another.\nThe first is vectorized, the second turns that into a loop, and the fastest uses BLAS.  Note that this was done in Julia 0.3.11.  The vectorized code is much faster, but still not fast, in 0.4.\n\nAlso note that you have to run each routine once before it will be fast.  This is because it compiles it the first time your run it\n\n\nn = 10^7\na = rand(n)\nb = rand(n)\n@time a += b;\n\nelapsed time: 0.155296017 seconds (80000312 bytes allocated)\n\na = rand(n)\nb = rand(n)\n@time add2(a,b);\n\nelapsed time: 0.021190554 seconds (80 bytes allocated)\n\na = rand(n)\nb = rand(n)\n@time BLAS.axpy!(1.0,b,a);\n\nelapsed time: 0.015894922 seconds (80 bytes allocated)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason that \na += b\n was slow was that it seems to allocate a lot of memory.\n\n\nHow should Julia packages be organized?\n\n\nIn yinsGraph, I decided to just make one big module called yinsGraph.jl.  It then includes a bunch of individual files, most of which contain many functions and types.  I think this is much nicer than making one file per functions, as some functions are very short.\n\n\nI put the export statements in the main module.  The reason for this is that while developing code in a file, I don't include that in the module.  This way I can reload it as I change it without having to restart the kernel.  This does not seem to work as well for types.  I'm not sure why.\n\n\nHow should notebooks play with Git?\n\n\nThe great thing about the notebooks is that they contain live code, so that you can play with them.  But, sometimes you get a version that serves as great documentation, and you don't want to klobber it my mistake later (or evern worse, have someone else klobber it).  Presumably if someone accidently commits a messed up version we can unwind that.  But, is there a good way to keep track of this?",

The steps to generate and improve it are:\n\n\n\n\nEdit Markdown files in the \ndocs\n directory.  For example, you could use MacDown to do this.\n\n\nIf you want to add a new page to the documention, create one.  Edit the file mkdocs.yml so show where it should appear.\n\n\nAdd docstrings to everything that needs it, and in particular to the routines you create.  The API is built from the docstrings.  To build the API, type\n\n\n\n\ninclude(\ndocs/build.jl\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \nmkdocs build\n in the root directory to regenerate the documentation from the Markdown.\n\n\n\n\nParametric Types\n\n\nA sparse matrix has two types associated with it: the types of its indices (some sort of integer) and the types of its values (some sort of number).  Most of the code has been written so that once these types are fixed, the type of everything else in the function has been too.  This is accomplished by putting curly braces after a function name, with the names of the types that we want to use in the braces.  For example,\n\n\nshortestPaths{Tv,Ti}(mat::SparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, start::Ti)\n\n\n\n\nTv\n, sometimes written \nTval\n denotes the types of the values, and \nTi\n or \nTind\n denotes the types of the indices.  This function will only be called if the node from which we compute the shortest paths, \nstart\n is of type \nTi\n.  Inside the code, whenever we write something like \npArray = zeros(Ti,n)\n, it creates an array of zeros of type Ti.  Using these parameteric types is \nmuch\n faster than leaving the types unfixed.\n\n\nData structures:\n\n\n\n\nIntHeap\n a heap that stores small integers (like indices of nodes in a graph) and that makes deletion fast.  Was much faster than using Julia's more general heap.\n\n\n\n\nInterface issue:\n\n\nThere are many different sorts of things that our code could be passing around.  For example, kruskal returns a graph as a sparse matrix.  But, we could use a format that is more specialized for trees, like the RootedTree type.  At some point, when we optimize code, we will need to figure out the right interfaces between routines.  For example, some routines symmetrize at the end.  This is slow, and should be skipped if not necessary.  It also doubles storage.\n\n\nWriting tests:\n\n\nI haven't written any yet.  I'll admit that I'm using the notebooks as tests.  If I can run all the cells, then it's all good.\n\n\nIntegration with other packages.\n\n\nThere are other graph packages that we might want to sometimes use.\n\n\n\n\nGraphs.jl\n : I found this one to be too slow and awkward to be useful.\n\n\nLightGraphs.jl\n : this looks more promising.
