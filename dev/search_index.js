    "text": "(Image: Build Status) (Image: codecov) (Image: )Laplacians is a package containing graph algorithms, with an emphasis on tasks related to spectral and algebraic graph theory. It contains (and will contain more) code for solving systems of linear equations in graph Laplacians, low stretch spanning trees, sparsifiation, clustering, local clustering, and optimization on graphs.All graphs are represented by sparse adjacency matrices. This is both for speed, and because our main concerns are algebraic tasks. It does not handle dynamic graphs. It would be very slow to implement dynamic graphs this way.The documentation may be found by clicking the \"docs\" link above.This includes instructions for installing Julia, and some tips for how to start using it.  It also includes guidelines for Dan Spielman\'s collaborators.For some examples of some of the things you can do with Laplacians, look atthis Julia notebook.\nLow Stretch Spanning Trees\nInformation about solving Laplacian equations\nAn example of sparsification\nAnd, try the chimera and wtedChimera graph generators.  They are designed to generate a wide variety of graphs so as to exercise code.If you want to solve Laplacian equations, we recommend approxchol_lap.The algorithms provide by Laplacians.jl include:akpw, a heuristic for computing low stretch spanning trees written by Daniel Spielman, inspired by the algorithm from the paper \"A graph-theoretic game and its application to the k-server problem\" by Alon, Karp, Peleg, and West, <i>SIAM Journal on Computing</i>, 1995.\napproxchol_lap: a fast heuristic for solving Laplacians equations written by Daniel Spielman, based on the paper \"Approximate Gaussian Elimination for Laplacians: Fast, Sparse, and Simple\" by Rasmus Kyng and Sushant Sachdeva, FOCS 2016.   For SDDM systems, use approxchol_sddm.\nharmonic_interp: Harmonic Interpolation on graphs.  Minimizes the Laplacians quadratic form subject to fixing values at certain vertices.\nsparsify, an implementation of sparsification by effective resistance sampling, following Spielman and Srivastava.\nKMPLapSolver and KMPSDDSolver: linear equation solvers based on the paper \"Approaching optimality for solving SDD systems\" by Koutis, Miller, and Peng, <i>SIAM Journal on Computing</i>, 2014.\nsamplingSDDSolver and samplingLapSolver, based on the paper \"Approximate Gaussian Elimination for Laplacians: Fast, Sparse, and Simple\" by Rasmus Kyng and Sushant Sachdeva, FOCS 2016.\nchimera and wted_chimera graph generators for testing graph algorithms, by Daniel Spielman.\nLocal Graph Clustering Heuristics, implemented by Serban Stan, including prn a version of PageRank Nibble based on \"Using PageRank to Locally Partition a Graph\", <i>Internet Mathematics</i> and LocalImprove based on \"Flow-Based Algorithms for Local Graph Clustering\" by Zeyuan Allen-Zhu and Lorenzo Orecchia, SODA 2014."

The old versions, using the pseudorandom generator from Julia V0.6 and Versions 0.2 of Laplacians, may be accessed by using the flag ver=Laplacians.V06, as in\na = chimera(2000, 1, ver=Laplacians.V06)\nThere do seem to be differences in the very low order bits of graphs generated by wted_chimera with the V06 option and those generated in Julia V0.6.  Not sure why.\nThe old generator is obtained by using the RandomV06 package for Julia.\nChanged the names of many functions to bring closer to the Julia standard naming scheme.  New names are emptygraph, pathgraph, ringgraph, completegraph, generalizedring, randgenring, productgraph, joingraphs, twolift ...  Set deprecation warnings for the old names.\nMoved lex.jl to the directory buggy, as on further testing we found bugs in it.\ndropped wGrid3, as it produced a 4d grid so probably wasn\'t being used anyway.  Dropped wGrid2 also."

So, we only hope to solve equations of the form  $ Lx = b $ when b is in the span of the matrix.  When the graph of the nonzero entries of the matrix is connected, this is precisely when the sum of the entries in $ b $ is zero.  Laplacian matrices are always positive semidefinite.A matrix $ M $ is a symmetric M-matrix if:It is symmetric,\nits off-diagonal entries are non-positive, and\nit is positive definite.A matrix symmetric $ M $ is diagonally dominant if each of its diagonals is at least the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal entries in its row.  A Laplacians matrix is diagonally dominant.  A diagonally dominant matrix is always positive semidefinite.A SDDM matrix (symmetric, diagonally-dominant M-matrix) is a matrix that is both diagonally dominant and an M-matrix.  You may think of a SDDM matrix as a Laplacian plus a non-negative, non-zero, diagonal matrix.  However, this is only guaranteed to produce a SDDM matrix when the graph underlying the Laplacian is connected.Laplacians.jl contains code for solving systems of linear equations in both Laplacian and SDDM matrices.  In fact, these problems are equivalent.  So, usually a solver for one type of system is implemented, and then wrapped to solve the other. The same ideas can be used to solve systems of equations in SDD matrices (the off-diagonals can be positive or negative), but a wrapper for these has not yet been written."

Not all routines obey this, but they try.\nverbose : set to true to display diagnostic information.\npcgIts : If the algorithm is iterative, this allows it to return the number of iterations it performed.  If pcgIts is an array of positive length, then its first entry is set to the number of iterations.  Where verbose prints this information, pcgIts allows it to be returned to other code.  To disable this set pcgIts to a zero length array, like Int[].Most of the solvers are iterative, exploiting the preconditioned conjugate gradient. These are the solvers for which maxits, maxtime and pcgIts make the most sense.  Some solvers, like Cholesky factorization, just ignore these parameters.All of these parameters may be set in the call that constructs f.  They may then be over-ridden by again setting them in the call to f.

Most of the code has been written so that once these types are fixed, the type of everything else in the function has been too.  This is accomplished by putting curly braces after a function name, with the names of the types that we want to use in the braces.  For example,shortestPaths{Tv,Ti}(mat::SparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, start::Ti)Tv, sometimes written Tval denotes the types of the values, and Ti or Tind denotes the types of the indices.  This function will only be called if the node from which we compute the shortest paths, start is of type Ti.  Inside the code, whenever we write something like pArray = zeros(Ti,n), it creates an array of zeros of type Ti.  Using these parameteric types is much faster than leaving the types unfixed."
