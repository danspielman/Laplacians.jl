Given a graph and an initial set, finds a set of smaller conductance based on the starting set using a localized version of max-flow.\n\nSmall discussion: When adding in the neighbors of the initial component, if the resulting  conductance is worse than the initial one,  the algorithm will add more and more vertices until hitting a better conductance. However, if we fix a certain  maximum size for our component,  it might be the case that this new conductance will always be worse than what we had initially. Thus, if we run the algorithm with a small maxSize,  our initial conductance might be the best solution we can raech.\n\nG is the given graph, A is the initial set \nepsSigma is a measure of the quality of the returning set (the smaller the better).
